        "## Background \n",
        "###### Crohn's disease is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease that affects the digestive tract. Children who have severe Crohn's disease generally undergo surgery, such as an ileo-cecal resection, to remove the diseased section of the colon in hope to relieve some of the symptoms. The treatment plan post surgery differs depending on institution standards. Some practices believe that initiating children on anti-tnf therapy, such as infliximab, to control their disease further after surgery will help prevent the disease for re-occuring in the retained healthy sections of the colon. As of now, there are no studies that prove what causes re-occurence in children with Crohn's post ileo-cecal resection and what may help prevent this. This dataset was gathered to explore possible clinical factors that may be indicators of disease recurrence post surgery. It is also meant to explore whether or not starting children on anti-tnf therapy shortly post surgery will affect whether or not patients have recurrence of disease. \n",
        "\n",
        "## Data Collection \n",
        "\n",
        "##### Different types of information such as disease phenotype, disease history, surgical history and medication history was abstracted from patients medical electronic charts. Limitations to the data include that not all patients had the required information, thus some rows were left blank (NaN).\n",
        "\n",
        "A patient gets a colonoscopy within the 1st year post surgery. This colonoscopy will be when physicians decide whether or not the patient has disease recurrence. Recurrence vs. non-recurrence was judged based on data from this first scope. "

        "The Kaplan Meier curve for anti-tnf treatment prior and post 2012 showed that the initial assumption that putting children on anti-tnf shortly after surgery starting at 2012 and after may not be correct. Selecting 2012 as a year was an assumption, thus this may not be the correct way to look at whether or not anti-tnf affect recurrence. The second Kaplan Meier curve showed that patients who started anti-tnf within 2 months post surgery have a better survival curve, however this was not significant so cannot support the hypothesis that starting anti-tnf shortly after surgery can prevent recurrence. I tested the alternate hypothesis, that people in the ER group just have more severe disease thus have recurrence, however the CHI2 test did not show significance, so this alternate hypothesis was also not supported. As of now, additional variables have to be tested to see if any have relation to recurring disease post resection. "
